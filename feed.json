We're currently working on Java WebSockets, and looking into the potential of using service workers to allow push notifications to be sent when a bid is ending, or when you have been outbid.</p>\n<p>These features will require a server to be running HTTPS, however do not require intensive server-side processing.</p>\n<p>We are also looking into the possibility of utilizing custom advancement messages for notifications. If that proves fruitful, we will develop a custom AdvancementAPI for ease of use in other plugins.</p>\n<p>Development is incredibly slow thanks to real life events having to take precedence, however we will continue working on Frostfire Auctions.</p>",
